# This is a BZFlag Server (bzfs) configuration file.
# It assumes that you wish to connect to the bzflag list server.
# Please read through it carefully.  Lines starting with a # are comments.
# to enable an option, remove the # at the beginning of a line.  To
# disable that option, put the # back.  There are some examples in this
# file.  Make sure you change the examples if you uncomment the line.  If
# you don't know what something does, you are okay to just leave
# it commented out.  Failure to read through this file (looking for
# already uncommented lines) might be a little embarrassing. Have fun.



# This option is for debug.  You can have as many as 4 of them.
# simple debug
#-d
# and more complex debugging.
#-dd
#-ddd
-dddd

# Sets the admin password for the server. It is necessary for server 
# administration if no groups are used.
# CHANGE THIS!
#-password abcdef

# Enables inertia and sets the maximum linear and angular accelerations.
# The units are somewhat arbitrary so you'll have to experiment to find
# suitable values.  The values must be non-negative and higher values
# yield greater inertia.
# Used to control "Mouse Enhancements"
-a 50 38


## World ##

# This specifies the world filename.
# Use this format for Windows
#-world "c:\workspace\bzflag-2.4.0_Windows\bin_Win32\empty.bzw"
# Use this format for *nix and Mac
#-world /users/noob/lousdesktop.bzw
#-world empty.bzw
#-world onebox.bzw
-world barrier.bzw

## Random World Generation ##

# This option allows world objects to be randomly rotated. Only applies
# if a randomly generated world is used.
#-b

# Enables capture-the-flag style game with a balanced random map. 
# Default is free-for-all style game.
#-cr

# Adds teleporters to the game. for random maps only
#-t

# This option controls the building density on random worlds(1-10) 
# Default is 5
#-density 7

# This option changes the size of random maps.
#-worldsize 800

# This option gives buildings random heights.  This is used when
# you are using random maps.
#-h


## Game Styles ##

# This enables capture-the-flag style game. Default is free-for-all style.
# Requires one base object for each team to be specified in the world file.
# Can be used with random world generation.
-c

# More than one team-flag may be specified. 
# This is generally not desirable.
# B* - Blue Team   G* - Green Team, P* - Purple Team,  R* - Red Team,
#+f B*
#+f B*

# This sets the maximum number of shots before a reload.  
# Default is 5.
-ms 1

# This makes most shots ricochet.
#+r

# This option allows jumping.
#-j

# These two flags can be used if they are not specified as options.
# +f R{1} # Ricochet
# +f J{1} # Jumping 

# This option allows for flags on box buildings.
#-fb

# This option allows tanks to spawn on buildings. This is especially useful
# as tank spawn locations are calculated on the server without the
# advantage of knowing where shots are.
#-sb

# By default if a player kills a teammate, he dies too, this option turns this
# off.  Used mostly for capture the flag style games.
#-tk

# Announce team kills to the admin channel.
#-tkannounce

# Kick a player if his ratio of teammate to non-teammate kills is this
# percentage or greater.
-tkkr 32

# This option allows you to tell the server how long a team flag remains
# before it is reset after the last player on a team leaves.  
# Default is 30 seconds.

# Use only one of these options.
# Choose rabbit based on score.
#-rabbit score
# Rabbit is chosen by whoever kills the rabbit.
#-rabbit killer
# Or you can choose the rabbit randomly.
#-rabbit random

# Open Free For All game is a teamless free-for-all game style. There are no
# teams, regardless of colors.
# Don't combine this with -c, -cr or -rabbit
#-offa

# It is possible to restrict bots and autopilot from being used on the server.
# This is accomplished with the following.
#-disableBots

# This option causes the server to quit after serving one game.  This is
# handy if you want to do a timed game, or script a rotating server.
#-g

# This option sets the max score for players.  The game ends when a player
# reaches this score and is declared the winner.
#-mps 100

# This sets the max team score.  The first team to reach this score is
# declared the winner and the game is ended.
#-mts 250

# This dumps the score to console when it changes.
#-printscore

# This sets time limit (in seconds) for the game.  Time starts when first
# client connects.
#-time 3600

# This option requires a timed game to be started using the /countdown
# command to start a timed game.  Default is when first player joins.
#-timemanual


## List server Connection ##

# This is the public message that the server advertises on the public
# server list.  This is required if you want to be shown on the list.
# It often advertises the map you are using.  Keep it short.
-publictitle "Noo BZFlag Server With Random Map"

# This is also needed to be listed on the public server list.  The
# address needs to be valid in DNS. It's your IP, plus port number.
-publicaddr 123.456.789.000:5154

# You need a public key to get your server listed on the official 
# listserver. Read here how to get one:
# http://wiki.bzflag.org/ServerAuthentication
-publickey XXXXXXXXXXXX

# The server will listen on this port.  Default port is 5154.
-p 5154

# Tells server not to respond to "pings". This makes the server private.
# You should remove -public and -publicaddr when using it.
# If your router is open, you can still give people your IP and port, and  
# they will be able to connect, you just wont be on the list.
#-q

# You probably don't need to use this, but it is there if you do.  This
# specifies where the server advertises itself.  The built-in default
# should work just fine.  You need to hunt down the proper address if
# it doesn't work. DON'T Change It
#-publiclist <list-server-url>

# Server will listen for and respond to "pings" (sent via broadcast) on
# the given interface.  The server uses the first interface by default.
# This is the TCP/UDP/IP address the server will listen on.
# You don't need to use this unless your server has multiple
# interfaces and doesn't show up on the server lists.
#-i 123.456.789.000


## Player Connections ##

# Automatically assigns players to teams when they join so that teams are
# evenly matched in number of players.  Players are placed on teams with
# lowest number of players first, then those with the lowest scores or
# kill ratios.
-autoTeam

# This sets the max number of players.  It can be done in 2 ways.  A flat
# count of players, or by number of players on a given team.
# This allows up to 50 players, no team limits.
# Typical home DSL connections max out at 12 players before lag begins.
# Lag equals players times shots. So a one-shot server could have more 
# players, and vice-versa. 
-mp 12

# This allows for max player by team.
# The order is rogue, red, green, blue, purple, observer.
-mp 0,4,4,0,0,1

# userdb can be used to map users to local groups. In most cases you can
# probably live without this. Consider using global groups instead. 
#-userdb /path/to/users.txt

# If you use the BZFlag forums at http://my.bzflag.org/bb
# and have established groups there, you only need groupdb
# Though local registrations can also be used.
# groupdb stores group to permission mappings.
#-groupdb /path/to/groups.txt

# If you have registered groups at the bzbb forums, only players
# in this group will see your server in the list. 
#-advertise NOOB.COP 

# This option kicks the user after they have been idle for a number of 
# seconds. Idle means paused, not-spawning or not-responding.  
-maxidle 300

# Set to not use a UDP connection for players. You typically do NOT want to
# do this (UDP is good!)
#-noudp

# Define a lag threshold over which players with high lag will be 
# announced to the admin channel.
#-adminlagannounce 300

# Define a threshold over which players with high lag will be announced.
#-lagannounce 400

# This option warns the user their lag is too high when it crosses the
# number of milliseconds set.
-lagwarn 350

# This option kicks players after they have been warned about high lag for
# a certain number of times.
-lagdrop 3

# Packetloss and Jitter are two different things.
# Packetloss is a percentage of total data being completely lost. 
# A player with packetloss is usually downloading files, switching
# between applications, or simply has a bad connection.
# Jitter is variation in the time between packets arriving, caused by network
#  congestion, timing drift, or route changes. 
# A player with jitter may be purposely manipulating his lag to avoid
# being shot, or to "lag through a wall".
# These next four functions should be used with caution, slower servers
# may wish to avoid using them altogether. 
 
# This option warns the user their packet loss is too high.
#-packetlosswarn 4

# This option kicks players after they have been warned about packet loss 
# a certain number of times.
#-packetlossdrop 2

# This option warns the user their jitter is too high when it crosses 
# the number of milliseconds set. 
# -jitterwarn 25

# This option kicks players after they have been warned about high 
# jitter for a certain number of times.
# -jitterdrop 3

# This option tells the server where to store the ban list. The ban list will
# be loaded from this file when the server starts (if the file exists) and
# written back to the file when someone gets banned or unbanned. If this
# option isn't used the ban list will not be saved.
#-banfile /path/to/mybanfile.txt

# This option sets up your ban list.  This is ip masks separated by commas.
# The * character is used as a wild card in range bans. 
#-ban "192.168.1.5,10.10.2.*,10.2.*.*"


## General Options ##

# adds timestamps to every line of the log
#-ts

# uses UTC for timestamps instead of localtime and implies -ts
#-utc

# -pidfile /path/to/pidfile.txt 
# Specify a file where the server will write its process ID so it may be used for remote administration. 

# This is the server welcome message.  Please change it. 
-srvmsg " This is a Noo BZFlag Server "
-srvmsg " Have Fun and Play Nice "

# Define a message which will be broadcast to all players every 15 minutes.
-admsg " Noo BZFlag Server "
-admsg " BZFlag is Fun "

# This sets the amount of time in seconds that is required to pass between
# two identical messages sent.
-spamtime 15

# This sets the amount of times to warn spammers (see -spamtime) before they
# are kicked.
-spamwarn 3

# Specify a file that contains bad words that will be used when 
# either -filterCallsigns or -filterChat is enabled.
# A multilingual badwords file can be found in source downloads. 
#-badwords /path/to/badwords.txt

# Turn on the filtering of chat messages.  Messages have words provided
# via a  -badwords file are replaced with !@#$%^&* characters.
#-filterChat

# Turn on the filtering of callsigns.  Callsigns are compared against
# bad words provided via -badwords.
#-filterCallsigns

# By default, all filtering is aggressive, matching much more than what
# is strictly listed in a -badwords file for convenience. Providing this
# option will make the -filterCallsigns and -filterChat comparisons
# exact match only.
#-filterSimple

# This forces all clients to use the same time of day.  The time is
# determined by the server's clock.  This disables the + and - keys
# on the clients.
#-synctime



## Player Controlled Functions ##

# This option specifies a help file that will be displayed when the player
# types /help name  
# Maximum length is 50 lines and 120 characters per line
#-helpmsg shock /path/to/shockwavehelp.txt 
#-helpmsg noob /path/to/noobhelp.txt

# You can specify a file so that people can type /report to report problems
# on the server.  The reports are logged in this file.
#-reportfile /path/to/reports.txt

# You can also use this option to cause the /report to trigger a command
# as well as, or instead of, logging to a file.
#-reportpipe command

# This specifies the number of seconds in which a poll can be vetoed.
#-vetoTime 60
